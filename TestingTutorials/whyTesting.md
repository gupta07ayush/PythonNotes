## Why we need testing:

1. Exponential increase in quality of code
2. We write a lot of information with testing which increases readability via documentation
3. We can add more features after testing
4. Testing is mainly used to reduce cost

## Why Unit Testing?

- Debugging and feature implementation
- find missing and hidden bugs
- Good Documentation Method

## 3 famous python testing frameworks

- unittest = It comes as default when we download python
- nose
- pytest = pip install pytest

- Assertion is a statement that asserts or states a fact and presents it confidently in the code. (Assertion means you are telling something and you are very confident about it.)
